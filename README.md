Things to do:

Script the whole setup:
    1. Service account creation
    2. Permissions for service account to specifically stop instance (custom role?)
    3. Ask for zone, project, instance
    4. Create function (http authenticated)
    5. Create Scheduler with asked variables in payload (application/json as type?) and target as the function
